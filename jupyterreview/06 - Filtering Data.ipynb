    "This phase of the task should be done as early as possible.  The less data in your dataframe, the less work you will have to do to transform it a process it, so its always a good idea to filter the data down to a smaller working set as you go. This may take more than one filter phase, and may require calculations to be done to work out what to filter out, but as a general rule of thumb, once you have a clean typed data frame, try to shrink it down to just what you need."

    "## How Filtering Works\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets look at how the pandas filtering works internally.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you do filtering or boolean indexing in pandas, you're specifying conditions to select specific rows (or columns) in the DataFrame (or Series). Here's a general overview of how this works:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: Evaluation of the Boolean Condition\n",
    "\n",
    "When you do something like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "df[df['Age'] > 30]\n",
    "```\n",
    "What happens under the hood is similar to applying the '>' operation to the 'Age' series, and this results in a Boolean series with the same index as that of DataFrame 'df'.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2: Masking with the Boolean Series\n",
    "\n",
    "This Boolean series is then used to mask the original DataFrame. It returns only the rows where the corresponding value in the Boolean series is True. Any False values result in those rows being dropped from the subset.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 3: Return Subset DataFrame\n",
    "\n",
    "The end result is a new DataFrame that includes only rows that satisfied the condition (or conditions when you use multiple conditions chained together with '&' or '|'). The original DataFrame remains unaltered, unless you assign the result to the original DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "For complex conditions, pandas use bitwise operators (& for and, | for or, ~ for not) instead of the typical python logical operators (and, or, not). For using bitwise operators, each condition has to be enclosed in brackets, as bitwise operators have higher precedence than comparison operators in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "For functions like isin and str.contains, pandas first figures out which rows (or columns) pass the condition and then the same process of masking happens.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's also important to note that the filtering operation in pandas is quite efficient, especially for large datasets, as under the hood pandas uses a vectorized approach (operating on whole arrays) for these computations. This makes pandas filtering faster and more performant than standard Python looping or list comprehension mechanisms."
